This Python program demonstrates basic list operations such as creating a list, appending elements, inserting elements at a specific position, extending a list, removing elements, sorting, and finding the index of a value.

Instructions
Create an empty list called my_list.

Append the following elements to my_list: 10, 20, 30, 40.

Insert the value 15 at the second position in the list.

Extend my_list with another list: [50, 60, 70].

Remove the last element from my_list.

Sort my_list in ascending order.

Find and print the index of the value 30 in my_list.
